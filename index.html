      <P>In this world animals are not so fortunate, unfortunately they are but in abusive situations. These consist of animal abuse by owners, labs and Zoos or any area that tries to contain "wildlife." These Zoos do nothing but torment these poor animals and make them completely lose knowledge on how to survive if they are to go back to their wild life. Being captive makes animals depressed, this emotionally drains the animal. As for abusive owners they physcially inflict harm upon their pets, some even cause fatal results. Labs for instance, they use animals for future developments such as makeup and medicine. While in the process animals such as rats or bunnies die. </P>

      <p>The reason why people such as scientist abuse animals is just for them to develop medicines or makeup that will have an affect on society. The abuse and sacrifice of animals benifts these people financially which is why this process of abuse is still ongoing. To add on owners abuse animals because they need a way to release their anger and some choose to direct that anger towards animals. On the other hand for Zoos or any place that holds marine life also, these peolple continue to hold animal captive due to the entertainment and good revenue they bring in.</p>

      <p>There are many ways to prevent further animal abuse. Such as educating yourself on the topic, become self aware that companies you may like might be performing such a disturbing act. Use this to form your own opinions on companies or any establishment. But in order for you to help change the actions and help prevent animal abuse is to donate to any shelter or poetntially foster an animal. But, of course these aren't the only options you have, you can donate towards a cause that protect animals. Also if you just roam the streets and stumble upon an animal in need don't be afraid to offer them a better place, a better life.</p>
